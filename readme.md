**Introductory Statement:**
<br>


We've tried three commerce methods, opting for pre-packaged modules in order to rely on the benefits of headless technology above and beyond frameworks alone such as Next.JS and REST API. We've designed our store from scratch using custom API's. And we've designed stores using Medusa.js and Vendure.io. I've found Medusa to be the easiest to use, seeing as the Documentation appears to be more cohesive for newer developers. While Vendure appears to be more 'polished', ultimately the learning curve appears to be too-high in order to get up and running quickly.
